# Stock Trend Prediction
#### This is a stock trend prediction web app. Stock data is downloaded from yahoo finance, hosted using streamlit share. I personally recommend you to use Pycharm to build your virtual environment. And the program probably cost a little time if you are not using the GPU version Tensorflow.


## Requirements
- numpy ~= 1.19.5 
- pandas ~= 1.3.4 
- matplotlib ~= 3.4.3 
- streamlit ~= 1.1.0 
- keras ~= 2.6.0 
- scikit-learn ~= 1.0.1
- TensorFlow ~= 1.0 (GPU version recommended)
